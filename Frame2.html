            <h1>Problems in Agriculture:</h1>
There are number of problems in our agriculture, for instance: 
1. Outdated modes of cultivation, which cause low per acre yield. 
2. Water Logging and Salinity. 
Attention is being given to these since mid 1960. 
3. Crop diseases are big problem. Technical support is being provided by Department of 
Agricultural. It helped to overcome the problem. Our inputs have problem of quality, 
which cause low prices in market. Other handicaps are low quality seeds, costly 
fertilizers, non-availability of electricity or oil for tube well etc. 
4. Water related problem, sometimes it is too little, but sometimes it is too much. Cleaning 
of Canals is also necessary to provide water at the end of canal. 
5. Credit facilities are also problematic. 
6. Access to market is difficult. 
7. Availability of reasonable price should be ensured for the welfare of the farmers and 
high yield of crop.
